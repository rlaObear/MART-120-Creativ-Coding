    <h3>My favorite books as a child.</h3>

    <p>Amelia Bedelia is the titular protagonist of the children's book series of the same name. 
      She is a maid who works for the couple Mr. and Mrs. Rogers. 
      She is a maid who often takes things to literally and makes certain tasks look goofy. 
      When Mrs. Rogers screams or see's what Amelia has done she is not usually pleased.
      One thing she got confused on was dressing a turkey. 
      She literally put clothes on the turkey and one other thing was when the Roger's told Amelia to hit the road aka scram. 
      Two minutes later she starts hitting the road with a broom.
      When Ms.Roger's asks what she is doing she says I'm doing what you told me "hit the road". 
      Sometimes, when the homonyms and homographs are confusing, then Rogers couples or people get angry but 
      they end up hilarious at the end of the book.</p>
